A Tree is a finite set T of one of more nodes, recursively defined, such that :
1. There is a specially designated node - root(T)
2. m >= 0 disjoint subsets T1 ... Tm that are themselves trees (called subtrees) and form a partition of the remaining nodes of T

Degree of a node - The number of subtrees of a node
Leaf - Terminal node with degree 0
Branch - Non-terminal node
